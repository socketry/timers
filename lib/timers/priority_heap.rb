module Timers
	# A priority queue implementation using a standard binary minheap. It uses straight comparison
	# of its contents to determine priority. This works because a Handle from Timers::Events implements
	# the '<' operation by comparing the expiry time.
	# See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap> for explanations of the main methods.
